this is also simple 
just instead of clicking vscode workspace , click on gui desktop workspace
but look at this :
1. Select the flag with your mouse.
2. Right click, Copy the flag.
3. The flag is now in the dojo's clipboard, but not your system's clipboard!
4. Click on the â–¸ button on the left edge of the Desktop.
5. Click on the Clipboard button. The Dojo's clipboard will appear!
6. You can now copy these contents to get them into your system's clipboard!
7. After copying the contents, paste them into the flag submission box!
