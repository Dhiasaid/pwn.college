This level will guide you through this concept. On your first attempt, it will ask you for a password that you don't yet know. When you get this password wrong, it will tell you what the right one is, but will then destroy the challenge and the flag file. You'll need to restart the challenge (go back to this page and click the Start button below!) to try again.
